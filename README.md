## Not Enough Pets features the following:

    When you tame any cat, it retains its skin rather than getting a random one
    Ocelots spawn in jungles, as usual. This means that tamed ocelots look like ocelots.
    Every other texture variation spawns in villages
    All of the JE 1.14 skins are backported and available, as well as multiple custom skins and the otherwise unused "gray tabby" skin
    JE 1.14 cat/ocelot sounds are implemented, as is one unused cat sound
    Parrots are backported from 1.12 to earlier versions
    There are multiple additional dog and parrot skins
    Tamed cats now have dye-able collars
    Swamp Huts spawn with a black cat
    Dog varieties spawn as village strays
    Wolf varieties are found in the wild
    There is a config setting to reduce the frequency of tamed cat/dog/parrot noises
    There are config settings to increase or decrease the buffer where a following cat/dog/parrot will teleport to you, and others to disable following of any sort
    There is a config setting to control how far you can fall before a parrot dismounts from your shoulder
    You can control what mob sounds the parrot mimics, and can include mob mods and sounds
    Ocelot-specific cats no longer avoid water, and non-Ocelot-type cats drop string on death
    Parrots do not leave your shoulders when you're riding on another entity (horse, mine cart, etc)
    Cat behavior, such as how to tame them and creeper avoidance, is unchanged
    Mooshrooms can sometimes spawn with a brown-mushroom texture
